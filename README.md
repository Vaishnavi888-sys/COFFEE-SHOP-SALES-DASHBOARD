# ‚òï Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard

A complete data visualization project built using **Google Sheets** to analyze the sales performance of a coffee shop chain across multiple locations. The dashboard gives actionable insights into revenue trends, product popularity, and customer preferences ‚Äî all derived from transactional data.

##  Project Objective :

To transform raw transactional data into a visually appealing and insightful dashboard that helps coffee shop managers and stakeholders understand:

- Which locations generate the highest revenue
- What product categories and sizes are most popular
- How sales vary by product type, store, and quantity
- How to use Google Sheets to create dynamic business dashboards


##  Dashboard Overview

The dashboard consists of six interactive charts:

1. **Location vs Product Type (Clustered Column)**  
   Visualizes how different products perform across stores (Astoria, Hell's Kitchen, Lower Manhattan).

2. **Highest Revenue by Store (Bar Chart)**  
   Shows total revenue earned by each store and helps identify top-performing branches.

3. **Popular Product Category (Column Chart)**  
   Displays the most sold product categories based on quantity.

4. **Size Share by Category (Pie Chart)**  
   Represents the proportion of each product category based on size type (Small, Regular, Large).

5. **Top Revenue-Generating Product Type (Bar Chart)**  
   Shows which individual products bring in the highest income.

6. **Location-wise Quantity Share (Pie Chart)**  
   Percentage distribution of total quantity sold at each store location.

##  Data Cleaning & Transformation

To prepare the data for analysis:

- **Extracted Size** from product names using text functions (`SEARCH`, `REGEXEXTRACT`)
- **Removed Size Tags** (e.g., "Rg", "Sm", "Lg") from product names using `SUBSTITUTE` and `REGEXREPLACE`
- **Split Date and Time** for time-based trends
- **Created Pivot Tables** to summarize data by location, category, product, size, etc.
- **Formatted Columns** for readability (currency, numbers, text)
- **Applied Filters** using slicers to make the dashboard interactive
